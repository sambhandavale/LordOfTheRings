    The Hobbit is a series of three epic high fantasy adventure films directed by Peter Jackson.
    The films are based on the 1937 novel The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien.The films take place
    in the fictional world of Middle-earth sixty years before the beginning of The Lord
    of the Rings, and follow hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), who is convinced by
    the wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) to accompany thirteen dwarves, led by Thorin
    Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), on a quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon
    Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch). The films expand upon certain elements from the novel and
    other source material, such as Gandalf's investigation at Dol Guldur which leads him to
    the Necromancer, and the heroes' pursuit by the orcs Azog and Bolg, who seek vengeance
    against Thorin and his kindred.
